# win-lab

A reproducible Windows VM on Ubuntu Server, built on `dockur/windows`: one
compose service running QEMU+KVM with a noVNC web viewer and RDP, backed by a
persistent disk in `storage/`.

See [[win-lab]], the service in [[win-lab/docker-compose.yml]] and the runbook
[[win-lab/README.md]].

## Service and endpoints

The `windows` service (container `win-lab`) serves the web viewer on `WEB_PORT`
(8006) and RDP on `RDP_PORT` (3389, tcp+udp).

It requires `/dev/kvm` and `/dev/net/tun` and `NET_ADMIN`. Host paths `storage/`,
`shared/` (guest drive Z:) and `oem/` (C:\OEM automation) are bind-mounted.
Configuration is environment-driven via [[win-lab/.env.example]].

## Lifecycle and readiness

`make boot` starts the VM and waits for the web viewer; `make wait-install`
blocks on the `storage/windows.boot` marker that signals the install finished.

Targets are in [[win-lab/Makefile]], readiness logic in
[[win-lab/scripts/wait-ready.sh]], host checks in [[win-lab/scripts/preflight.sh]].
The three readiness stages are container `Up`, web viewer HTTP 200 (visible
during install too), and the `windows.boot` marker (install complete).

## State, backup and reset

All guest state is in `storage/`; configuration is `.env` plus compose.

[[win-lab/scripts/backup.sh]] takes a cold, crash-consistent archive (unless
`--live`); [[win-lab/scripts/restore.sh]] moves the current `storage/` aside
before extracting, so restores are reversible. `make reset CONFIRM=yes` destroys
the disk and reinstalls on next boot.

## Research

Windows-lab research and the command reference.

They live in [[win-lab/knowledge]] and [[win-lab/dockur-windows-cheat-sheet.md]].
Cross-lab operation is via [[labctl]] (`./labctl win ...`).
